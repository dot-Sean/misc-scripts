randcowsay.sh
=============

Invokes fortune to generate a random funny message and renders it with cowsay.
Actually not really useful, but I am using it for my MOTD. ;)

Usage: ./randcowsay.sh


run_when_online.py
==================

Uses NetworkManager to idle until the network gets online and runs a given
command. This is useful for example, if you are updating your system automized
and don't want miss your daily update, if your network was offline at that time.

Usage: ./run_when_online.py [-p <pid_file>] <command>


xmessages_monitor.py
====================

Monitors the directory /var/log/xmessages (make sure you created it before). And
calls xmessage for each file in the directory and removing it after that. This
enables you to log messages displayed to the currently logged in user, just by
creating text files in /var/log/xmessages, without detecting whether X is
running and which user is currently logged in. Messages logged before running
xmessages_monitor.py got displayed when you run xmessages_monitor.py the next
time, so you should ensure, xmessages_monitor.py is called after X started.

Usage: ./xmessages_monitor.py
